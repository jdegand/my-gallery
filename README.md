## Features

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://web.archive.org/web/20240526045248/https://legacy.devchallenges.io/challenges/gcbWLxG6wdennelX7b8I) was to build an application to complete the given user stories. **Note**: The previous design document may be incomplete, as you need to find an archived version of the challenge as all `legacy` challenges have had their documentation removed from DevChallenges.
